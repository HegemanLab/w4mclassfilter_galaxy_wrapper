# W4M Data Subset

#### A Galaxy tool to select a subset of Workflow4Metabolomics data

*W4M Data Subset* is [Galaxy tool-wrapper](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/dev/schema.htm) to wrap the
[w4mclassfilter R package](https://github.com/HegemanLab/w4mclassfilter) for use with the
[Workflow4Metabolomics](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/) flavor of
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/).
This tool is built with [planemo](http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Author

Arthur Eschenlauer (University of Minnesota, esch0041@umn.edu)

#### R package wrapped by this tool

The *w4mclassfilter* package is available from the Hegeman lab github repository [https://github.com/HegemanLab/w4mclassfilter/releases](https://github.com/HegemanLab/w4mclassfilter/releases).

#### Tool in Galaxy toolshed

The "w4mclassfilter" Galaxy tool, built from this repository, is in the main Galaxy toolshed at [https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=5f24951d82ab40fa](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=5f24951d82ab40fa)

#### Tool updates

See the **NEWS** section at the bottom of this page

## Motivation

GC-MS and LC-MS experiments seek to resolve chemicals as features that have distinct chromatographic retention time ("rt") and (after ionization) mass-to-charge ratio ("m/z" or "mz"). Data for a sample are collected as MS intensities, each of which is associated with a position on a 2D plane with dimensions of rt and m/z. Ideally, features would be sufficiently reproducible among sample-runs to distinguish features that are commmon among samples from those that differ. However, in practice, the chromatographic retention time for a chemical can vary from one sample-injection to the next.

Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M, [Giacomoni et al., 2014, Guitton et al. 2017]) is a "flavor" of Galaxy that uses the XCMS preprocessing tools [Smith et al., 2006] for "retention time correction" to align features among samples; features may be better aligned if pooled samples and blanks are included.

Multivariate statistical techniques may be used to discover clusters of similar samples [Thévenot et al., 2015]. However, once retention-time alignment of features has been achieved among samples in GC-MS and LC-MS datasets, the presence of pools and blanks may confound identification and separation of clusters. Multivariate statistical algorithms also may be impacted by missing values or dimensions that have zero variance.

## Description

The W4M Data Subset tool selects subsets of samples, features, or data values for further analysis.

- The tool takes as input the data matrix, sample metadata, and variable metadata datasets produced by produced by W4M's XCMS [Smith et al., 2006] and CAMERA [Kuhl et al., 2012] tools.
- The tool produces as output the same trio of datasets, modified as follows:

This tool performs several operations to address several data issues that may impede downstream statistical analysis:

- Samples that are missing from either sampleMetadata or dataMatrix are eliminated.
- Features that are missing from either variableMetadata or dataMatrix are eliminated.
- Features and samples that have zero variance are eliminated.
- Samples and features are sorted as specified or, by default, alphabetically.
- The names of the first columns of variableMetadata and sampleMetadata are set respectively to "variableMetadata" and "sampleMetadata".
- Negative intensities become missing values.
- If desired, the values in the dataMatrix may be log-transformed.
- If desired, each missing value in dataMatrix is replaced with zero or the median value observed for the corresponding feature.

This tool also can perform several operations to reduce the number samples or features to be analyzed (although **this should be done only in a statistically sensible manner** consistent with the nature of your experiment):

- Samples may be eliminated by filtering on a designated “sample class” column in sampleMetadata.
- Features may be eliminated by specifying minimum or maximum value (or both) allowable in columns of variableMetadata.
- Features may be eliminated by specifying minimum or maximum intensity (or both) allowable in columns of dataMatrix for at least one sample for each feature (“range of row-maximum for each feature”).
- If desired, a "center" for each treatment can be computed in lieu of the samples for that treatment.

The W4M Data Subset tool may be applied several times sequentially; for example, this may be useful for viewing clusters of progressively smaller subsets of samples.
